# How it works
1) Make your profile, enter info (with socials)
2) You're initially able to view the people (first names only) any of the groups you're interested in -> floating profile pictures, random word gen names (make it funny, conversation starter)?
3) You can send them a request to connect, if they accept you can see their socials and they can see yours
